        Most conference participants will arrive through Calgary International
        Airport (YYC), which is located in the northeastern part of the city.
        International visitors will most likely clear Canadian customs in the

        We recommend taking a cab or an Uber from the airport to your
        accommodation. A taxi into central Calgary will generally be between $30
        - $40 CAD, with an Uber usually being slightly less. Taxi stands can be
        found outside of both domestic and international arrival terminals.
        While there is bus service that connects the airport to parts of
        Calgary, it will be a slow process and we don&apos;t recommend it.

        too, the most convenient option being the LRT (‚ÄúC-train‚Äù) which has a

        well as stops in trendy neighbourhoods such as Kensington/Sunnyside (Red

        . If you have the time we recommend using the Bow River Pathway as a
        great way to see the city. The pathway runs through (or close to)
        several central Calgary neighbourhoods that line the Bow River,
        including Kensington/Sunnyside, Bridgeland, East Village, and Inglewood.
        All of these neighbourhoods have fantastic restaurants, bars, and shops
        to explore.

        There are several shuttle options that connect Calgary to Banff,
        Kananaskis, and Lake Louise. These offer the convenience of not having
        to worry about parking in these very popular resorts, which is extremely
        limited. However, for any other trips outside of the city, you&apos;ll
        need to rent a car.
